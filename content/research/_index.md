At **MAVENs**, we work in **Computational Condensed Matter Physics**, leveraging
**Density Functional Theory (DFT)** and _ab-initio methods_ to explore the electronic and
magnetic properties of advanced materials. Our mission is to contribute to the development of
materials for **green energy applications** through a combination of computational techniques and
data-driven approaches, i.e. Machine Learning.

<!-- MAVENs investigates complex materials, including alloys and molecules, with a focus on energy and -->
<!-- caloric applications. -->

<!-- Employing DFT and Monte Carlo simulations, we unravel the interplay between -->
<!-- electronic structure, magnetism, thermodynamics, and symmetry in disordered systems. Our aim is to -->
<!-- engineer materials with optimized properties, such as critical temperature ($\mathsf{T_C}$), Gibbs -->
<!-- free energy ($\mathsf{\Delta G_H}$), and magnetic anisotropy, for applications in green hydrogen -->
<!-- catalysis and magnetocaloric cooling. -->

<!-- Our research encompasses 2D molecules, disordered alloys, Heusler alloys, and MXenes. -->
