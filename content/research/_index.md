 The research at MAVENs focuses on understanding and manipulating the properties of complex materials, such
 as alloys and molecules, with a particular emphasis on energy and caloric materials.

By employing advanced computational techniques like density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo
simulations, we investigate the intricate relationship between electronic structure, magnetism,
thermodynamics, and symmetry in disordered systems. Our goal is to uncover the fundamental
principles governing these interactions and to leverage this knowledge to design materials with
tailored properties.

Specifically, we aim to optimize parameters such as critical temperature ($T_C$), Gibbs free energy
($\Delta G_H$), and magnetic anisotropy to develop superior catalysts for green hydrogen production and
highly efficient magnetocaloric materials.


## Materials Design
The MAVENs utilizes a potent fusion of Monte Carlo and Density Functional Theory (DFT)
techniques to advance the field of materials design. By employing this synergistic methodology, we
are able to conduct an in-depth analysis of the fundamental properties of matter, including the
atomic-level electronic structure, energies, and thermodynamics of substances.

We employ the accuracy of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to forecast the behaviour of materials
under various circumstances, whereas Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide a statistical perspective
on the intricate interaction of variables in complex systems. By harnessing this capability, we
explore the domain of disorder effects and unveil labyrinthine pathways to materials possessing
customized functionalities.

By adopting this comprehensive strategy, we not only enhance our foundational comprehension of
materials but also create opportunities for advancements in various technologies. Our objective is
to manipulate the electronic and magnetic characteristics of materials by modifying them at the
atomic scale. This customization would specifically concentrate on functionalities such as caloric
effects, hydrogen evolution reactions, and qubit materials.

## Materials Discovery using ML
By capitalizing on the advantages of both the DFT and the MC method, MAVENs accelerates and
improves material discovery through the application of machine learning (ML). Despite the provision
of precise electronic structure data by DFT, the prohibitive computational expense impedes
extensive material investigation. MC simulations are remarkable for examining large configuration
spaces, except from the limitation imposed by the configuration space's size. By incorporating ML
into this framework, a material discovery pipeline that is both robust and efficient is
established.

ML models acquire knowledge of the intricate correlations that exist among material structure,
composition, and properties via DFT calculations. This knowledge empowers them to forecast the
properties of unobserved materials with remarkable precision. Using this method, we can effectively
test the most theoretically promising materials found through the extensive MC simulations. This
lets us focus our next high-fidelity DFT and MC calculations on those materials.

Hence, by employing this integrated methodology, one can effectively and harmoniously traverse the
extensive domain of prospective materials while expediting the identification of materials
possessing specific functionalities.

Our exploration spans various material landscapes, including 2D molecules, disordered alloys, Heusler alloys, and MXenes.
