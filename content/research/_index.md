 The research at MAVENs focuses on understanding and manipulating the properties of complex materials, such
 as alloys and molecules, with a particular emphasis on energy and caloric materials.

By employing advanced computational techniques like density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo
simulations, we investigate the intricate relationship between electronic structure, magnetism,
thermodynamics, and symmetry in disordered systems. Our goal is to uncover the fundamental
principles governing these interactions and to leverage this knowledge to design materials with
tailored properties.

Specifically, we aim to optimize parameters such as critical temperature ($T_C$), Gibbs free energy
($\Delta G_H$), and magnetic anisotropy to develop superior catalysts for green hydrogen production and
highly efficient magnetocaloric materials.

Our exploration spans various material landscapes, including 2D molecules, disordered alloys, Heusler alloys, and MXenes.

We work on two different paths to achieve the goal:
