MAVENs investigates complex materials, including alloys and molecules, with a focus on energy and
caloric applications.

Employing DFT and Monte Carlo simulations, we unravel the interplay between
electronic structure, magnetism, thermodynamics, and symmetry in disordered systems. Our aim is to
engineer materials with optimized properties, such as critical temperature ($\mathrm{T_C}$), Gibbs
free energy ($\mathrm{\Delta G_H}$), and magnetic anisotropy, for applications in green hydrogen
catalysis and magnetocaloric cooling.

Our research encompasses 2D molecules, disordered alloys, Heusler alloys, and MXenes.
