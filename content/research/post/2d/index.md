2D materials have emerged as one of the most versatile and promising materials in nanoscience due to their unique physical and chemical properties. These materials, consisting of atomically thin layers, exhibit exceptional electronic, optical, and mechanical properties that make them highly desirable for next-generation technologies. Our group investigates these materials using state-of-the-art computational methods, aiming to explore their potential in various applications, including electrocatalysis, quantum information processing, and green energy storage.

## Research Areas
### 1. Electrocatalysis for Hydrogen Evolution Reactions (HER)
Hydrogen is a cornerstone of sustainable energy technologies. Developing efficient electrocatalysts to facilitate the HER process is critical to advancing green hydrogen production. We study the catalytic properties of 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes, and their doped counterparts, to improve HER performance. Our work focuses on reducing the Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (Î”G\(_{\text{H*}}\)) and enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency through electronic structure tuning and defect engineering.

### 2. Quantum Information Processing
2D materials have shown immense potential as hosts for deep centers, which serve as stable qubits in quantum information systems. We employ computational approaches to identify host materials and design configurations that exhibit high coherence times and optical addressability. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we accelerate the discovery of materials with optimal properties for applications in quantum computing and secure communication.

### 3. Energy Storage and Conversion Applications
The demand for efficient energy storage and conversion technologies has led us to explore 2D materials for their applications in batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. Their high surface area, conductivity, and tunable properties make them ideal candidates. We focus on tailoring these properties through doping, functionalization, and heterostructure formation for targeted applications.

## Methodologies
We employ density functional theory (DFT) to study the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of 2D materials. Advanced methodologies such as Monte Carlo simulations are used to analyze phase transitions and thermal properties. Machine learning is integrated into our workflow to expedite the discovery of materials with desired characteristics, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in our predictions.
