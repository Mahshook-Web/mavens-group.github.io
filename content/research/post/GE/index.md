The transition to sustainable energy technologies requires the discovery of advanced materials that can drive green energy solutions. Our research focuses on exploring novel materials for electrocatalysis, energy storage, and conversion applications using first-principles calculations. By tailoring the electronic and catalytic properties of materials, we aim to address challenges in hydrogen production, energy storage, and renewable energy generation.

## Research Areas

### 1. Enhancing Gibbs Free Energy for HER
Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is at the core of green hydrogen production. We aim to enhance the Gibbs free energy of electrocatalysts, ensuring high efficiency and low overpotential. Our studies involve designing doped alloys, 2D materials, and heterostructures to optimize the electronic structure and improve catalytic performance.

### 2. Energy Storage and Conversion Applications
Energy storage and conversion are critical to renewable energy systems. We investigate advanced materials for use in batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. By leveraging first-principles calculations, we explore the potential of new material configurations, ensuring high energy density, stability, and cost-effectiveness.

### 3. Novel Material Configurations
The discovery of novel material configurations is a key focus area. From high entropy alloys to 2D material composites, we explore various possibilities to create sustainable materials tailored for specific green energy applications.

## Methodologies
We utilize DFT to analyze the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of materials. Monte Carlo simulations aid in understanding phase transitions, while machine learning techniques accelerate the discovery process. By combining computational methods, we bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental realizations, driving innovation in sustainable energy technologies.
