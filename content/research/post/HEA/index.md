High Entropy Alloys (HEAs), characterized by their multi-component and disordered atomic structures, have gained significant attention for their extraordinary mechanical, magnetic, and electronic properties. These materials break traditional alloying rules and offer a new paradigm in material design, particularly for energy-efficient applications. Our group explores HEAs through computational investigations to tune their properties and discover new compositions suitable for green energy technologies.

## Research Areas

### 1. Magnetic and Structural Tuning through Doping
Doping plays a pivotal role in modifying the magnetic and structural properties of HEAs. By strategically introducing dopants, we aim to control phase transitions, magnetic ordering, and mechanical properties. These studies help in designing HEAs with optimized performance for various applications, including electrocatalysis and energy storage.

### 2. Phase Transitions in HEAs
Understanding phase transitions in HEAs is crucial for determining their stability and functional properties. We investigate the effect of temperature, pressure, and composition on the phase behavior of these alloys. Monte Carlo simulations combined with DFT calculations allow us to study these transitions in detail and provide insights into the correlation between structure and properties.

### 3. Novel HEA Compositions for Energy-Efficient Applications
HEAs offer unique opportunities for developing materials with high thermal stability, corrosion resistance, and enhanced electronic properties. Our focus lies in discovering novel compositions for use in energy-efficient technologies, including magnetocaloric applications and renewable energy systems.

## Methodologies
Our approach integrates DFT and Monte Carlo simulations to understand the fundamental mechanisms governing the properties of HEAs. We also use machine learning to predict promising alloy compositions, accelerating the discovery process and enabling the design of tailored materials for specific applications.
