abstract: "In this paper we shall study three binary alloy systems, one constituent of which is Mn.
The other constituents are chosen from a particular column of the periodic table: Ni(3d), Pt (4d)
and Pd (5d). As we go down the column, the d-bands become wider, discouraging spin-polarization. In
a disordered alloy, the situation becomes more complicated, as the exchange interaction between two
atoms is environment dependent. We shall compare and contrast their magnetic behaviour using robust
electronic structure techniques. In all three alloy systems conjectures are made to explain
experimental data. In this paper we shall examine whether there is any basis to these conjectures."
