abstract: "The effects of rhenium doping in the range 0–10 at.% on the static and dynamic magnetic properties of Fe65⁢Co35 thin films have been studied experimentally as well as with first-principles electronic structure calculations focusing on the change of the saturation magnetization (𝑀𝑠) and the Gilbert damping parameter (𝛼). Both experimental and theoretical results show that 𝑀𝑠 decreases with increasing Re-doping level, while at the same time 𝛼 increases. The experimental low temperature saturation magnetic induction exhibits a 29% decrease, from 2.31 to 1.64 T, in the investigated doping concentration range, which is more than predicted by the theoretical calculations. The room temperature value of the damping parameter obtained from ferromagnetic resonance measurements, correcting for extrinsic contributions to the damping, is for the undoped sample 2.1×10−3, which is close to the theoretically calculated Gilbert damping parameter. With 10 at.% Re doping, the damping parameter increases to 7.8×10−3, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 7.3×10−3. The increase in damping parameter with Re doping is explained by the increase in the density of states at the Fermi level, mostly contributed by the spin-up channel of Re. Moreover, both experimental and theoretical values for the damping parameter weakly decrease with decreasing temperature."
