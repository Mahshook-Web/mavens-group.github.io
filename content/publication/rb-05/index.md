abstract: "We report here an experimental study of magnetization of FeNiW alloys at different compositions. We have studied variation of magnetization with temperature (at low external fields) and magnetic field (at low temperatures). The alloy shows para to ferromagnetic transitions across the composition range. We do not find any indication of the spin-glass phase. We have supplemented the experimental work with theoretical analysis using the first-principles tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbitals based augmented space recursion method. Our theoretical estimates of magnetic moment and Curie temperatures agree well with experiment. Our mean-field phase analysis also does not indicate the possibility of a spin-glass phase."
