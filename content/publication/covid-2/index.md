abstract: "Since the first patient was detected in India in late February 2020, the SARS-CoV-II
virus is playing havoc on India. After the first wave, India is now riding the second wave. As was
in the case of European countries like Italy and the UK, the second wave is more contagious and at
the time of writing this paper, the per day infection is as high as 400,000. The alarming thing is
it is not uncommon that people are getting infected multiple times. On the other hand, mass
vaccination has started step by step. There is also a growing danger of potential third wave is
unavoidable, which can even infect kids and minors. In this situation, an estimation of the
dynamics of SARS-CoV-II is necessary to combat the pandemic. We have used a modified SEIRD model
that includes vaccination and repeat infection as well. We have studied India and 8 Indian states
with varying SARS-CoV-II infections. We have shown that the COVID-19 wave will be repeated from
time to time, but the intensity will slow down with time. In the most possible situation, our
calculation shows COVID-19 will remain endemic for the foreseeable future unless we can increase
our vaccination rate manifold."
