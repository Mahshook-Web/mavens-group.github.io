abstract: "We present here an optimized and parallelized version of the augmented space recursion
code for the calculation of the electronic and magnetic properties of bulk disordered alloys,
surfaces and interfaces, either flat, corrugated or rough, and random networks. Applications have
been made to bulk disordered alloys to benchmark our code."
