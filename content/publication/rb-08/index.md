abstract: "Unlike other transition metals alloyed with a non-magnetic metal, alloys of Ni behave
rather differently. This is because of the fragility of the local magnetic moment on Ni. NiMo and
NiW do not show any spin-glass phase. However, addition of Fe can bolster the moment on Ni. We wish
to study whether the alloy Fe3.3Ni83.2Mo13.5, chosen near a composition where mean-field estimates
suggest there could be a spin-glass phase, shows such a phase or not."
