abstract: "We model changes of magnetic ordering in Mn-antiperovskite nitrides driven by biaxial
lattice strain at zero and at finite temperature. We employ a non-collinear spin-polarised density
functional theory to compare the response of the geometrically frustrated exchange interactions to
a tetragonal symmetry breaking (the so called piezomagnetic effect) across a range of Mn$_3$AN (A =
Rh, Pd, Ag, Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, In, Sn) at zero temperature. Building on the robustness of the effect
we focus on Mn$_3$GaN and extend our study to finite temperature using the disordered local moment
(DLM) first-principles electronic structure theory to model the interplay between the ordering of
Mn magnetic moments and itinerant electron states. We discover a rich temperature-strain magnetic
phase diagram with two previously unreported phases stabilised by strains larger than 0.75% and
with transition temperatures strongly dependent on strain. We propose an elastocaloric cooling
cycle crossing two of the available phase transitions to achieve simultaneously a large isothermal
entropy change (due to the first order transition) and a large adiabatic temperature change (due to
the second order transition)."
