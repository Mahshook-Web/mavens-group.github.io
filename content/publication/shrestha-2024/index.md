abstract: 'Nowadays, the family of transition metal trihalides(MX3), where M denotes a transition
metal cation and X stands for halogen anion (X= Cl, Br and I) has transpired to be an engrossing
area of research due their applications in context of spintronics. MX3 is well known magnetic
semiconductor as well as layered material. The crystals are attached by weak interlayer van der
Waals interaction and can be exfoliated into bilayer or monolayer structure. Though these materials
have been revealed for more than 50 years, a lot of information are yet to be experimentally
explored. Here in this study, we have investigated on metal trichlorides and tribromides of V, Cr
for both the possible space groups R3Â¯ and C2/m, through Density Functional Theory (DFT). From the
calculated DOS plot, we have showed trichlorides and tribromides of V and Cr appear to be
semi-metallic and insulators respectively. Through this study we have also arrived at the
conclusion that VCl3 and VBr3 appear to be favorable in designing better spintronic devices ...'
