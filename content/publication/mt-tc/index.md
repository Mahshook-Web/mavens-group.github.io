abstract: "Temperature dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and magnetization of
the prototypical rare-earth magnet YCo5 is calculated from first principles, utilizing the
relativistic disordered local-moment approach. We discuss a strategy to enhance the
finite-temperature anisotropy field by hole doping, paving the way for an improvement of the
coercivity near room temperature or higher. Â© 2014 American Physical Society."
