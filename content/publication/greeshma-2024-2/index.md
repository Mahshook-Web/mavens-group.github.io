abstract: 'Electrochromic batteries (ECBs) represent a novel integration of energy storage and
optical modulation technologies, offering versatile applications from smart windows to portable
electronics. This work explores the potential of zinc-ion (Zn2+) electrochromic batteries utilizing
tungsten trioxide (WO3) as an active material. To address research gaps, the study focuses on
coating techniques and hybrid ion electrolytes to enhance performance and sustainability. Spray
coating with ethanol solvent demonstrates superior uniformity and film quality compared to
de-ionized water, attributed to Marangoni flow effects. Moreover, hybrid Zn-K electrolytes show
enhanced electrochromic and electrochemical performance, offering higher ΔT (50 %) modulation and
cyclic stability (10000 s). Theoretical analysis confirms the favorable interaction of K+ ions with
WO3. Prototype ECB devices exhibit exceptional cyclic stability (3000 cycles), rapid self-charging
capabilities (10 min), and reversible optical modulation (40 %), showcasing the potential for
sustainable energy storage solutions in smart electronics.'
