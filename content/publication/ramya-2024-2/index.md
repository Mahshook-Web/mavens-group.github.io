abstract: 'Polymer nanocomposites play a critical role in various industries, including pack-
aging, sensors, biomedicine, sports equipment, and automotive manufacturing, due to their unique
properties and customizable design. Polymer nanocomposites play a critical role in various
industries, including packaging, sensors, biomedicine, sports equipment, and automotive
manufacturing, due to their unique properties and customizable design. To maximize their
performance and reliability, a comprehensive understanding of their mechanical behaviour is
paramount. The evolution of mechanical properties by incorporation of nanoparticles is still far
from well understood even for very common polymer nanocomposite like \(PMMA/TiO$_2$\). The aim of the
current work is to study the change in mechanical properties of \(PMMA/TiO$_2$)\ due to the change in
electronic structure of nanocomposite as a result of systematic variation of \(TiO$_2$\). In this
research, the electronic structure of the PMMA/TiO2 nanocomposite at different wt% of
\(TiO$_2$\) are
studied and the mechanical properties of these nanocomposites are also estimated using Density
Functional Theory (DFT). The mechanical properties of \(PMMA/TiO$_2$\) thin films with different TiO2 wt%
are meticulously examined experimentally using the nanoindentation technique at various loading
rates. The mechanical properties obtained from DFT analysis matches well with the experimental
study which indicates a strong correlation between the electronic structure and the mechanical
properties. The study reveals that there exist an optimum \(TiO$_2$\) wt% beyond which the mechanical
properties are not increasing due to the electronic configuration of the nanocomposite'
