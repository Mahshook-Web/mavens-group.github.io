abstract: "New magnetic materials with high Curie temperatures for spintronic applications are perpetually sought for. In this paper, we present an ab initio study of the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Quaternary Heusler compounds CoX′Y′Si where X′ is a transition metal with 4d electrons and Y′ is either Fe or Mn. We find five new half-metallic ferromagnets with spin polarisation nearly 100% with very high Curie temperatures. The variation of Curie temperatures as a function of valence electrons can be understood from the calculated inter-atomic exchange interaction parameters. We also identify a few other compounds, which could be potential half-metals with suitable application of pressure or with controlled doping. Our results reveal that the half-metallicity in these compounds is intricately related to the arrangements of the magnetic atoms in the Heusler lattice and hence, the interatomic exchange interactions between the moments. The trends in the atomic arrangements, total and local magnetic moments, interatomic magnetic exchange interactions and Curie temperatures are discussed with fundamental insights."
