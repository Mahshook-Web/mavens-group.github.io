abstract: "In this communication we carry out experimental investigation of the behavior of
magnetization with temperature and magnetic field of six samples at different compositions of the
disordered ternary alloy NiFeMo. We analyze the data using a fist-principles density functional
based electronic structure method and a mean-field phase diagram study."
