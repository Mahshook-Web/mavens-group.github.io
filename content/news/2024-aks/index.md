The first fruit of collaboration of MAVENs with [AKS Research
Group](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshksingh-cens/home) led by [Dr Ashutosh
Singh](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshksingh-cens/team/dr-ashutosh-k-singh) is published at
[ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c04445).

Aqueous electrochromic batteries (ECBs) have recently garnered significant attention within the
realm of renewable rechargeable technology due to their potential applicability in diverse
multifunctional devices featuring visible-level indicator batteries. However, there exists an
imperative to comprehend the underlying structural factors that contribute to achieving an elevated
electrochemical performance.
In this work, [AKS Group](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshksingh-cens/home) has synthesized
and compared $\mathsf{WO_3Â·H_2O}$ (HWO) specifically for heightened ECB application as against the
performance context, of a standard anhydrous $\mathsf{WO_3}$ (AWO).

MAVENs deployed a DFT study to unravel that the underlying reason of such behaviour is driven by
Jahn-Teller distortion of the crystal structure due to intercalated water molecule.

MAVENs are very happy and congratulates Mr Rahul (from AKS) and [Greeshma](../../author/greeshma-r)
for not only carrying out the work, but also leading the project from the front.
