We are excited to announce the publication of our latest research, conducted in collaboration with
the [AKS group led by Dr Ashutosh Singh](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshksingh-cens) at CeNS, Bangalore, in the Energy
Storage Materials.

This study, titled "[Self-rechargeable aqueous Zn2+/K+ electrochromic energy storage device via
scalable spray-coating integrated with Marangoni flow](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1jYJ08Z1RY5kB7)", is a big step toward making aqueous zinc-ion
batteries that work well and are useful.

Through our collaborative efforts, [Greeshma R](../../author/greeshma-r)
from the MAVENs group has contributed essential theoretical insights, while the experimental
validation and device fabrication were expertly executed by our colleagues at CeNS. This marks our
second successful collaboration with AKS group, building upon the foundation laid in our previous
research published in [ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c04445).

By combining our theoretical understanding with AKS' experimental expertise, we have successfully
demonstrated a scalable spray-coating technique integrated with Marangoni flow for enhanced battery
performance. This breakthrough has the potential to accelerate the development of sustainable
energy storage solutions.

We are grateful for the fruitful collaboration with the CeNS team and look forward to future
research endeavours together.
