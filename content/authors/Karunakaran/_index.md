**Karunakaran M** is a Research Scholar in the [Department of Physics and
Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/)
at [SRMIST, KTR](https://www.srmist.edu.in).
He is one of the members of the **M**aterials **A**dvancing a **V**iable **EN**ergy future (MAVENs) Group.

Karunakaran applies _ab-initio_ density functional theory, KKR-CPA, and Monte Carlo methods to
investigate the system properties. His research is dedicated to exploring the electronic, magnetic,
and thermodynamic characteristics of systems for green-energy applications such as magnetocalorics
and spintronics. He is deeply passionate about enhancing and controlling the systems'
properties, performance, and efficiency through doping. With over three and a half years of active
involvement in the field of Heusler alloys, his current research focuses on controlling the
electronic and magnetic properties of disordered Heusler alloys.
