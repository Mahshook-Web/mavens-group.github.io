I am an assistant professor at the Department of Physics and Nanotechnology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I am the group leader of Impact Group.

My research deals with computational material science, specifically developing and applying Monte Carlo and ab-initio DFT code and CPA to study magnetism in disordered alloys and molecules.

Please visit our group webpage for more details about my research and work.

My research group values our team members' creativity, critical thinking, and independence. If you share our passion for innovation, check out the open positions in our group.
