Harshaa is a Master's student in the [Department of Physics and
Nanotechnology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/department/department-of-physics-and-nanotechnology/) at
[SRM Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/).

Her research focuses on employing advanced computational techniques to investigate Monte Carlo
methods applied to the various Bravis lattice structures like Heusler alloys, perovskites etc. Her work encompasses
the simulation of physical systems and data analysis within the realm of materials science, with
potential implications for astrophysics. The study aligns with the broader objective of applying
computational and analytical methodologies to address complex problems in computational physics.
