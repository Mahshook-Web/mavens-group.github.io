        IMPACT Group
      text: |
        The IMPACT Group, led by Dr. Rudra Banerjee within the Department of Physics and Nanotechnology at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, stands at the forefront of computational materials science, driven by a shared vision: a sustainable future through cutting-edge materials exploration.

        Our research tackles critical challenges in green energy and related domains. We design novel catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), engineer magnetocaloric materials for energy-efficient cooling, and push the boundaries of qubits materials.

        Fuelled by a deep understanding of materials, we employ advanced research methods like density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations, coupled with cutting-edge high-throughput computation and machine learning. This integrated approach fosters groundbreaking exploration and discovery.

        If you are a talented M.Sc. student in Physics, Chemistry, or Materials Science, and share our passion for innovation, we invite you to join our journey. Explore our open positions and contribute to shaping a sustainable future alongside our vibrant research community.
