      title: _You may say **we** are a dreamer_
      text: |
        The MAVENs group, based within the Department of Physics and Nanotechnology at SRM
        Institute of Science and Technology, dreams a cleaner environment to breath for the next
        generations by developing innovative materials solutions for green energy using computational
        modelling.

        With a focus on green energy technologies, the MAVENs team is actively engaged in the design of
        novel catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the engineering of magnetocaloric
        materials for energy-efficient cooling, and the exploration of qubit materials for quantum
        computing applications.

        Our research methodology combines advanced computational techniques, including density functional
        theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations, with high-throughput computing and machine learning. This
        interdisciplinary approach enables us to accelerate the discovery of promising materials and
        optimize their properties.

        We invite talented MSc students with a passion for physics, chemistry, or materials science to join
        our dynamic research group. By working alongside our experienced researchers, you will have the
        opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research and develop the skills necessary for a
        successful career in academia or industry.

        To learn more about our research and available positions, continue to our website.
